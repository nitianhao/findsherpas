## What this blog is

This blog is about **on-site search optimization**—not SEO. We’ll cover what actually moves the needle once a user is already on your site:

- Search UX patterns that reduce friction
- Relevance tuning that improves discovery
- Analytics design that makes search debuggable

## Who it’s for

If you own an ecommerce search, a marketplace search, or content search, you’re in the right place.
